  description: "PEARL is Hackney Wick's favourite local, serving good coffee, brunch, dinner, craft beers, wine and cocktails.\nWe started our journey with nothing more than a DIY attitude. No, we weren't experts in hospitality by any stretch but we knew all we wanted\_from a\_local cafe was a warm greeting, excellent coffee and good value food. Taking over the old Hackney Pearl founded in 2011, we found\_ourselves in the epi-centre of an artistic warehouse community,\_our aesthetic\_fit perfectly. This was an environment\_with rough edges made beautiful by the interactions found everywhere you turn.\_\nWhen we opened in 2016 our friendly attitude carried us through the learning process. We listened to what our regulars wanted and became a firm part of the community,\_providing caffeine for artists,\_curing warehouse party hangovers with our generous brunches, even\_sharing a drink in the evening with our\_neighbours. What's more, we attracted some lovely\_people who wanted to be part of\_our team.\nOff the back\_of 'don't be a dick', we become\_something really special. A vibrant venue draped in\_plants, filled with local art, good music, delicious food, excellent coffee, craft beers and delicious cocktails all\_served by the friendliest team in East London.\n"
