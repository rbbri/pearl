    PEARL is Hackney Wick's favourite local, serving good coffee, brunch, dinner, craft beers, wine and cocktails.

    We started our journey with nothing more than a DIY attitude. No, we weren't experts in hospitality by any stretch but we knew all we wanted from a local cafe was a warm greeting, excellent coffee and good value food. Taking over the old Hackney Pearl founded in 2011, we found ourselves in the epi-centre of an artistic warehouse community, our aesthetic fit perfectly. This was an environment with rough edges made beautiful by the interactions found everywhere you turn. 

    When we opened in 2016 our friendly attitude carried us through the learning process. We listened to what our regulars wanted and became a firm part of the community, providing caffeine for artists, curing warehouse party hangovers with our generous brunches, even sharing a drink in the evening with our neighbours. What's more, we attracted some lovely people who wanted to be part of our team.

    Off the back of 'don't be a dick', we become something really special. A vibrant venue draped in plants, filled with local art, good music, delicious food, excellent coffee, craft beers and delicious cocktails all served by the friendliest team in East London.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
