     Dinner at Pearl takes you on a journey as our well-travelled head chef, Daria, serves dishes from around the world. Created alongside her Mexican Chef-de-Partie, Victor, we serve the best Tacos in East London with authentic salsas, flavours, and a corn tortilla base. Head to the bar and order one of our 'Trio of Margaritas' to wash it down. Our evening menu caters for vegans, vegetarians and meat lovers. And of course, our famous burgers feature on this menu too, alongside spicy addition, 'The Mexican'.
